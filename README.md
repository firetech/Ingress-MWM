Ingress-MWM
===========
Ingress' notifications don't work with the "other apps" support in MetaWatch
Manager Community Edition, since they have no ticker text.

This app solves that problem by using an accessibility service and then uses
some clever hacks to get the actual text from the notifications.

Installation
============
Download `Ingress-MWM_signed.apk` to your device and install it.  
Make sure you allow "unknown sources" installations.  
You'll also need [MetaWatch Manager Community Edition](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.metawatch.communityedition).
